Personal Health Records on the Blockchain

Storing of Personal Health Records on the blockchain will take advantage of the security, 
confidentiality and user authentication properties available on the Ethereum network. 

Smart Contracts, Ethereum accounts and Test Networks will be used in the creation of the system. 

Web3js is used to provide an interface between the contract and the user. 
Nextjs for server rendering
Reactjs for the client-side rendering.
